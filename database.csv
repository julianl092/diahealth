How do I get my baby to latch properly when breastfeeding? ,"Latching is difficult for most mothers! The ""correct"" latch is one in which the baby's mouth is fully open and able to create a great seal. One effective way to do this is to have Mom's nipple directed at the baby's nose. This sets off a natural reflex in the baby to open wide. Once the baby has opened wide, the baby should be brought to the mother's breast and solidly placed on the breast.",Breastfeeding,Feeding,0-3 months,Ensuring Proper Latch On (Healthy Children),,,,
How do I reduce the pain when breastfeeding?,"No one really talks about how painful breastfeeding is. If it hurts, you’re not alone! To avoid bleeding and cracked nipples, make sure that your baby is latched properly with their lips completely sealed around your breast. After feeding, gently pat your nipples dry and try applying colostrum, breast milk, or medical-grade purified lanolin to soothe your nipples. 

Some women will experience ""let-down"" pain for the first 10-15 seconds of the feed, this pain should go away after this period.  If it does not, other sources of pain in the breast should be identified.  Take note of where you are experiencing pain - is it in the outer quadrants of the breast tissue? the nipple itself? is it during the feed or after the feed? is it a shooting pain or a cramping pain? This will help to identify the source of the pain.  Most often, nipple pain is related to a latch that is shallow.  While working on improving the latch (this can take time!), follow these tips (as you write in the blurb).  Make sure to take baby off the breast after the feed and try to not let baby just sleep on the nipple; you will know when the baby is done with the feed when baby either a) lets go on his/her own, b) starts to loosen the latch and/or just ""nibble"" at the nipple - to easily break the seal, place your pinky finger in the corner of the baby's mouth to remove baby without hurting your nipple.
